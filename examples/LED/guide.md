The Arduino UNO has a built-in LED on the digital pin 13. You can use this LED to test the code. We've also provided you some functions to make it easier to produce patterns with the LED. You can find the functions in the `BIDFestTools` library.

# Hardware
- Arduino

You don't need any additional hardware to run this example.

# Code
```cpp
void setup() {
    initializeLED();  // Initialize the LED on digital pin 13
}
```
